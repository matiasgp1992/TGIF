            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
              Openness, accountability, and honesty define government
              transparency. In a free society, transparency is government's
              obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart
              of how citizens hold their public officials accountable. Here at
              TGIF we believe that government should be transparent.
            </p>
            <p>
              Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how
              officials conduct the public business and spend taxpayer money
              must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency
              allows good and just governance. Transparency promotes
              accountability and provides information for citizens about what
              their Government is doing.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also believe that government should be participatory. Public
              engagement enhances the Government's effectiveness and improves
              the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in
              society, and public officials benefit from having access to that
              dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use our site to become
              actively engaged in American government.
            </p>
            <p>
              TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can
              readily find and use. We solicit public feedback to identify
              information of greatest use to the public.
            </p>

                    <h3>Background History of Government Transparency</h3>
                    <p>
                      In the West, the idea that government should be open to
                      public scrutiny and susceptible to public opinion dates
                      back at least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many
                      philosophes made an attack on absolutist doctrine of state
                      secrecy, a core part of their intellectual project. The
                      passage of formal legislative instruments to this end can
                      also be traced to this time with Sweden, for example,
                      (which then included Finland as a Swedish-governed
                      territory) enacting free press legislation as part of its
                      constitution (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This
                      approach, and that of the philosophes more broadly, is
                      strongly related to recent historiography on the
                      eighteenth-century public sphere.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in
                      America (1776) and France (1789), freedom of the press
                      enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary
                      accounting and freedom of the press in constitutional
                      articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts by
                      Metternichean statesmen to row back on these measures were
                      vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal
                      politicians and writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton prominent
                      among the latter.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of
                      contemporary democratic practice and is often linked to
                      the passing of freedom of information legislation.
                      Scandinavian countries claim to have adopted the first
                      freedom of information legislation, dating the origins of
                      its modern provisions to the eighteenth century and
                      Finland continuing the presumption of openness after
                      gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act on Publicity
                      of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new
                      legislation in 1999).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act
                      (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to Information Acts (AIAs)
                      or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in
                      1970.
